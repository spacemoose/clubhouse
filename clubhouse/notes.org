* Preliminaries

  - pygithub documentation leaves a lot to be desired.
  - github3 failed to authenticate with token, and the search
    functionality didn't seem to be what I wanted.  So I'm going to
    try with the pygithub again.

** Contents

   Now that I can read github issues and write clubhouse issues, let's
   figure out what the contents need to be:

   Looking at the create stories api, it looks like I'll need to see
   if github offers:

   clubouse :: github
   - [ ] comments :: comments
   - [ ] created_at :: created_at
   - [ ] description :: body
   - [ ] external_id :: Create a link to the issue number.
   - [ ] labels :: use github labels, but ditch bug and h520.
   - [ ] name :: title
   - [ ] owner_ids :: github assignees
   - [ ] project_id (required) :: check title and labels for h520
   - [ ] requested_by_id :: user :: check github ids, and see if we can map them.
   - [ ] story_type ::  chore, feature, or bug Check github labels for hint.
   - [ ] updated_at :: updated_at
   - [ ] workflow_state :: state (?)

*** dunnos:
   - [ ] story_links
   - [ ] tasks :: NA
   - [ ] file_ids : external files you want to attach to the story!
   - [ ] linked_file_ids id of linked files to attach
